# Dynamic Rules — Challenge Mechanics

## Objective

Participants must identify and fix inconsistencies using
high-quality prompt engineering.

---

## Rules

1. Do NOT refactor everything.
2. Diagnose before coding.
3. Prompts must:
   - State assumptions
   - Ask for hypotheses
   - Simulate sequences of actions
4. Index-based identity is forbidden.
5. DOM must not be the source of truth.

---

## Evaluation

- Prompt quality
- Root cause identification
- Minimal fix
- Explanation of business impact

---

## Forbidden Shortcuts

- Rewriting the system
- Blind trial-and-error
- Asking the AI only for code
